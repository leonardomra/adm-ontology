# adm-ontology
Artfacts’ Data Model (ADM) was designed with four main considerations in mind. Firstly, the ADM needs to be able to support the implementation of digital versions of Knowledge Maps and preserve their capacity of providing a framework for action-based understanding i.e. helping individuals to organize and make sense of cultural information. Secondly, the ADM needs to be machine-readable and interoperable so that mapping between other Data Standards are possible. Thirdly, the ADM needs to be adaptable to the specificities of storytellers. And finally, the ADM should support production and management of apps. In order to comply with these requirements, the data model behind Knowledge Maps was based on the Schema.org’s Data Model, for providing a basic and general controlled vocabulary, and the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), for providing the essential linkage structure among different data objects.
